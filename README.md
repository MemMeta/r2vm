# rvm

RVM is the **R**ust **VM** for **R**ISC-**V** **M**achines.

RVM uses dynamic binary translation to run RISC-V supervisor and userspace software on AMD64 Linux machines. It is initially based on the my similar C++ project `riscv-dbt`, which written as the University of Cambridge Part II project and leads to [my dissertation](https://garyguo.net/uploads/riscv-dbt.pdf).

RVM aims to use the strength of Rust to build a fast and maintainable simulator and emulator for RISC-V machines.
